  "description": "-node allow to run js directly on server side how computer actually understand code ? -computer are really understand machine code but that is really complex to write and read -computer can not directly understand js or compile it to machine code so we can not directly run js on computer(server side) -but js can work on browser ? how ? ----an engin called the v8 engin and the v8 engin is written in c++ by google and it is compiles js into machine code at runtime ----so by passing js code through v8 engine in the browser , the computer can then understand js within the context of the browser -hoeever it can not run js outside the browser because there is no v8 engine compiling it down outside the browser -okey and this is where the role of node   -node js is aprogram also written in c++ and that wraps the v8 engine -so this v8 engine that is in browsers also lives inside node -well because node written in c++ it can run directly on our computer -so by installing and running node on our computer it can take our js and can run it through v8 compiler that it has it inside it -and v8 compiler inside node can compiles js into machine code",
